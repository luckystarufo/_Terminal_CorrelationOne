# Terminal Game Strategy
[Terminal](https://terminal.c1games.com/home) is a new kind of online game, where players compete by writing 
algorithms that automate play of the game. Top coders from around the world showcase their algos in live e-sports 
tournaments, playing for cash prizes, exclusive job opportunities, and global acclaim.

## Note: This repo doesn't provide my code anymore, as requested by Correlation One. They told me not to share complete algos, as people will continue to work for a while and can be uploaded ‘as is’ which creates some issues.
